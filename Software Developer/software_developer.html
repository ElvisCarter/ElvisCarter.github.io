    <h1>What do Developers do?</h1> 
		<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="Software_Developer.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>Every business that generates its own computer programs or needs to personalize
		third-party software needs software engineers to write, edit and test programs. There
		are many layers of computer software, and each requires a specialist in languages 
		specific to that layer. Software engineering is a rapidly changing field: training in
		software is available at nearly all learning institutions, and most software engineers
		continue to learn on the job, as languages and development environments evolve.</p>
		
		<p>Software engineers tend to specialize in a few areas of development, such as networks,
		operating systems, databases or applications, and each area requires fluency in its own set
		of computer languages and development environments. A small percentage of software engineers
		work alone, but most collaborate with other specialists in development groups all working 
		together to create complex projects.</p>
